# barnsley fern
I saw an interesting post on [/r/factorio](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/mumy5x/growing_the_barnsley_fern_in_factorio/) where a user had made a display out of lamps, and used them to plot a Barnsely fern.

Seeing that it could be achieved in Factorio's circuit system, I thought it wouldn't be too hard to try and render a Barnsely Fern in python's popular plotting library, matplotlib. These are the results of those efforts.
